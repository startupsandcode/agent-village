# Agent Village

Agent Village is a repo based workflow for managing software work with Codex. GitHub Issues holds the ticket queue; Codex in VS Code is the working surface. The main Codex conversation acts as Maya, the engineering lead, and coordinates specialized agents for architecture, implementation, review, and product design when a task benefits from them.

The workflow runs in VS Code with Codex and GitHub access. There is no application to install, build, or host. The former Vercel project is disconnected from this repository, so pushes do not deploy a site.

## Start here

1. Open this repository in VS Code with the Codex extension.
2. Connect to GitHub for issue and pull request work. If you use the GitHub CLI, sign in with `gh auth login`.
3. Start a Codex chat in this repository and talk to Maya directly. Ask her to draft a GitHub Issue from the [work item template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/work-item.md).
4. Once the issue is ready, ask Maya to coordinate work on its number. Review the branch, verification evidence, and linked pull request before merging.

For example:

```text
Maya, help me turn this request into a GitHub Issue. Make the outcome and acceptance criteria concrete before creating it: ...

Maya, coordinate issue #12. Read its acceptance criteria, inspect the relevant code, make the smallest change on a branch, verify it, and prepare a PR linked to the issue. Ask Theo or Susie for input only if the design needs it; ask Quinn to review the result.
```

## Agents

Maya is the default lead because [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) instructs the primary Codex conversation. The project scoped definitions in [`.codex/agents/`](.codex/agents/) are optional custom agents:

| Agent | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| Theo | Architecture and technical tradeoffs |
| Sam | Implementation |
| Quinn | Independent review |
| Susie | Product design and usability |

Ask Maya to delegate a focused task to one of these agents when useful. They do not watch GitHub Issues or run on a schedule.

## Reuse for a client

Fork or copy the repo, adapt `AGENTS.md` and the agent definitions to the client's delivery process, and use that repo's GitHub Issues for its queue. Keep client credentials and project data in the client's own environment. Add automation only after the manual issue-to-PR loop works reliably for that team.

The active instructions are in `AGENTS.md` and `.codex/agents/`. The retired proof of concept is available in Git history.
